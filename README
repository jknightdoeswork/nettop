Run 'make' to build the runnable file

foo.top is a sample input network built by us that displays what
our program is capable of executing. You are free to modify it as
you see fit, or build your own.

To run our sample topology, use './nettop foo.top'

A reference of the available commands can be found in nettop.pdf
for building your own topology and executing queries.

After running all of the commands in the topology file, it will
then turn over the ability to input your own commands via stdin.

Not specifying a topology file (just running ./nettop) will
immediately turn control over to the user to build the network
and execute queries on the fly.



Our program was built to run on tuxworld. If ran elsewhere, you
*may* have to modify the makefile to not include -lpthread when
compiling.
